## Profile
My research focuses on refactoring and test quality assurance, specifically the impact analysis of refactoring to improve software quality and test efficiency. I am actively analyzing refactoring techniques applied to test code to enhance test quality. Additionally, I am involved in multiple international collaborative research projects, working closely with researchers from universities in the Netherlands, China, and Canada.<br>
I also have hands-on experience as a QA Engineer, specializing in test quality assurance and test automation. Motivated by a desire to solve challenges discovered in real-world development and to contribute to the overall quality of software in society, I have decided to pursue a Ph.D.
