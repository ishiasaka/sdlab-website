Our laboratory, in collaboration with Kyushu University, has started a new project funded by the "ASPIRE for the Next Generation (AI and Information)" program by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). The project has been awarded a total of 900 million yen. This research project, titled "International Brain Circulation Initiative for Context-Aware AI in Software Development," aims to promote international collaborative research.

The ASPIRE Program for International Joint Research Promotion aims to accelerate international brain circulation by connecting top researchers from Japan and leading scientific and technological countries and regions through international joint research in strategically important scientific and technological fields. This initiative seeks to build cutting-edge research and development networks and foster the next generation of top researchers.

In this research project, Professor Yasutaka Kamei (Kyushu University) will serve as the principal investigator, with Assistant Professor Yutaro Kashiwa (NAIST) and Assistant Professor Masanari Kondo (Kyushu University) as co-investigators. The project aims to realize "Context-Aware Software Development AI" (research period: December 2024 to March 2028). Specifically, the project will develop AI technologies that understand and adapt to the context in software development, aiming to improve development efficiency and quality. Additionally, the project aims to nurture the next generation of researchers by inviting and visiting top researchers from overseas. Students in our laboratory, especially those aspiring to pursue doctoral studies, will be dispatched abroad for extended periods to develop as next-generation researchers and form networks.

Our international research collaborators include Professor Ahmed E. Hassan (Queen's University, Canada), Professor Gabriele Bavota (Universit√† della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland), Professor Alexander Serebrenik (Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands), Associate Professor Shane McIntosh (University of Waterloo, Canada), Senior Lecturer Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn (Monash University, Australia), Assistant Professor Lingming Zhang (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, USA), and Assistant Professor Gemma Catolino (University of Salerno, Italy), all of whom are leading researchers in their respective fields.

If you are interested in joining our laboratory and conducting AI-related research abroad, please feel free to contact us.
