On November 13, 2024, Kota Nakagawa from our laboratory presented at [IEICE Technical Committee on Internet Architecture (IA)](https://ken.ieice.org/ken/program/index.php?mode=program&tgs_regid=338bbd75c3dc3b74f16a3e741361826684d5e2cca7d3482390dd3b8bcfbc49af&tgid=IEICE-IA&layout=&lang=eng).

He introduced his research titled ["A Proposal of Optimizing Path Selection Based on INT Delay Measurement"](https://ken.ieice.org/ken/paper/202411130c5L/eng/), which proposed a method for selecting low-latency paths using In-band Network Telemetry (INT) and SRv6. His presentation was recognized with a Student Research Award.
