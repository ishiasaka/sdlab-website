Ryoji Agatsuma from our laboratory gave a presentation at the [IEICE Technical Committee on Knowledge-Based Software Engineering](https://ken.ieice.org/ken/program/index.php?mode=program&tgs_regid=afbc90002f0936bdece38fc022c74799b776b6b8b0068652b346850b7d2d938d&tgid=IEICE-KBSE&layout=&lang=eng) held from March 21st to 22nd, 2025.

Under the title "Construction of a Scenario Model for the Integrated Evaluation of Safety and Smooth Road Traffic Interactions in Automated Driving Systems," Mr. Agatsuma presented on a scenario model and an associated evaluation method capable of simultaneously assessing both the safety of automated driving systems and their smooth road traffic interactions with surrounding participants. This research proposed a method for the integrated analysis and evaluation of safety and traffic smoothness by constructing a scenario model with a three-layer structure (Physical, Behavior & Perception, Prediction & Intention) and extending the existing safety analysis method STAMP/STPA.
