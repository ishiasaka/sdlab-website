Shan Gao, a second-year master's student in our laboratory, presented his research at [IPSJ SIG Internet and Operation Technology (IOT)](https://www.iot.ipsj.or.jp/).


He introduced his research titled "A node selection algorithm for hybrid peer-to-peer services based on a modified dueling-DQN model", which evaluated a modified dueling-DQN model for node selection in P2P environments, and received a Student Research Award.
