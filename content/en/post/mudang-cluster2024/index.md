Mr. Soratouch Pornmaneerattanatri, a D3 student from our laboratory, presented the following paper at the [2024 International Workshop on Large Language Models (LLMs) and HPC](https://llmhpc.github.io/2024/), co-hosted with [IEEE Cluster 2024](https://clustercomp.org/2024/):

> Soratouch Pornmaneerattanatri, Keichi Takahashi, Yutaro Kashiwa, Kohei Ichikawa, Hajimu Iida, Automatic Parallelization with CodeT5+: A Model for Generating OpenMP Directives, 2024 International Workshop on Large Language Models (LLMs) and HPC, September 24, 2024.

This paper proposes a novel approach to automatic parallelization tools using natural language processing models. By fine-tuning the CodeT5+ model, the proposed method improves the accuracy of automatic parallelization tools for generating OpenMP directives compared to traditional static analysis techniques.
