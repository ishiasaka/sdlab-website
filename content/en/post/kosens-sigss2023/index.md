Mr. Kosei Horikawa and Ms. Miku Watanabe, students in Nara National College of Technology and our collaborators (Internship students), presented their studies at the SIGSS workshop (non-peer-reviewed), held on March 14-15th, 2023 in Okinawa.


Mr. Horikawa presented his paper titled ["Toward Investigating the Impact of Refactoring on Test Execution Time"](https://ken.ieice.org/ken/paper/20230315wCSl/). This study explores the frequency, types of test code refactoring, and its impact on test execution time. 

Ms. Watanabe presented her paper titled ["Toward Investigating the Impact of Adopting Rapid Release on Self-Admitted Technical Debt Introductions"](https://ken.ieice.org/ken/paper/20230315mCSm/). The paper investigates how SATD introduction/removal changes before and after adopting rapid release.
