Nabhan Suwanachote, an intern student in our laboratory, presented the following paper at
[30th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC 2023)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/apsec-2023)
 on Dec 4th-7th, 2023. 

> Nabhan Suwanachote, Soratouch Pornmaneerattanatri, Yutaro Kashiwa, Kohei Ichikawa, Pattara Leelaprute, Arnon Rungsawang, Bundit Manaskasemsak, Hajimu Iida:
> "A Pilot Study of Testing Infrastructure as Code for Cloud Systems", In Proceedings of the 30th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC 2023), Dec. 2023.


This study examined the repositories using Terratest in order
to reveal how developers test infrastructure on cloud systems.
We collected 59 repositories that use Terratest modules and
conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses.
Throughout our empirical study, we found that (i) 55.2%
of the repositories using Terratest have at least one server
infrastructure test; (ii) developers often maintain server infrastructure tests (1.7%-11.3% commits out of all the commits);
(iii) many repositories have tests for system functionality
(28%), deployment (20%), and configuration (17%).

The accepted paper is available on GitHub:
