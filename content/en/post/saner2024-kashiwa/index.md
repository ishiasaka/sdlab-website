Assistant professor Kashiwa collaborates with Waterloo University, Luxembourg University, and Kyushu University and their paper has been accepted at one of the top conferences in the field of Software Engineering, The 31st IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering. SANER took place in Rovaniemi (Finland) on 12th - 15th March, 2024. The accepted paper is described as follows. 

> Issei Morita, Yutaro Kashiwa, Masanari Kondo, Jeongju Sohn, Shane McIntosh, Yasutaka Kamei, Naoyasu Ubayashi, 
> “TraceJIT: Evaluating the Impact of Behavioral Code Change on Just-In-Time Defect Prediction”, International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER'24), Mar. 2024.

This paper has proposed a technique to detect bugs by monitoring significant changes in software behavior, which can be used on continuous integration. Throughout an empirical study on Apache Commons projects, we observed that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques (14.8% improvement of PR-AUC).
