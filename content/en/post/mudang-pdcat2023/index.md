Mr. Soratouch Pornmaneerattanatri, a second-year doctoral student at SDLab presented the following paper at the [24th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT2023)](http://kips-cswrg.org/pdcat2023/)

> Soratouch Pornmaneerattanatri, Keichi Takahashi, Yutaro Kashiwa, Kohei Ichikawa, Hajimu Iida, "Parallelizable Loop Detection using Pre-trained Transformer Models for Code Understanding", 24th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT2023), August. 2023.

In this paper, we proposed a alternative methodology for automatic parallelization tool for classify parallelizable For-loop using deep learning based natualral language processing model. In this approach, we improve the accuracy of the automatic parallelization tools to identify the parallelizable For-loop by fine-tuned CodeT5 model compared to traditional approach, static analysis.
