Kosei Horikawa from our laboratory received the Best International Poster Award at the Software Engineering Symposium (SES2025).
The Student International English Poster Session, a special event at SES2025, is a valuable opportunity to present research in English and engage in discussions with internationally renowned researchers, such as Professor Daniel German from the University of Victoria and Assistant Professor David Moreno from Rey Juan Carlos University. This award is presented to the most outstanding poster presentation of the session.
Mr. Horikawa presented his work titled, "Understanding Refactoring in Test Code: An Empirical Study." This research analyzes test-specific refactoring, which is performed to improve test code quality. The analysis identified 37 types of test-specific refactorings. Furthermore, it was revealed that certain refactorings can effectively improve some test smells (indicators of quality degradation, such as test code complexity).
