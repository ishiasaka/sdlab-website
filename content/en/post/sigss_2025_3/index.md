Tatsuya Shirai and Riku Kato from our laboratory presented at the [Technical Committee on Software Science (SS)](https://ken.ieice.org/ken/program/index.php?mode=program&tgs_regid=467a2ef7771c23683bb71c6ec6b3ca61a419e5c002fb2d05466b685a2ac8ce77&tgid=&layout=&lang=eng), held from March 10 to 12, 2025.

〇〇 presented his paper titled [""](). 

Mr. Kato presented his paper titled ["Proposal of Just-In-Time Vulnerability Prediction using Continuous Fuzzing"](https://ken.ieice.org/ken/paper/20250312Xc8u/). He proposed a "Just-In-Time vulnerability prediction" method using continuous fuzzing data, which demonstrated 5.4% to 13.6% higher performance in predicting vulnerabilities compared to conventional feature-based prediction methods, as revealed through experiments on 78 OSS projects.
