Miss Kang Xingyuan(Mya), a first-year doctoral student at SDLab presented the follwing paper at the [2023 Eleventh International Symposium on Computing and Networking(CANDAR)](https://www.cs.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/Proceedings23/CANDAR%202023/index.html#!/toc/0)

> Kang Xingyuan, Keichi Takahashi, Chawanat Nakasan, Kohei Ichikawa, Hajimu Iida, "Multi-Objective Optimization of Controller Placement in Distributed ONOS Networks", 2023 Eleventh International Symposium on Computing and Networking(CANDAR), 28th November - 1st December 2023.

This paper focuses on the optimal placement of SDN controller in SDN technology, which can realize the programmable network operation through software. When managing a network with multiple distributed controllers, its deployment is a complex problem given the latency from individual switches and the synchronization of data between controllers. Therefore, as a formulation of multi-purpose optimization problem, a method to optimize controller and data synchronization node configuration is proposed.
