Mr. Tomoki Sugiura of our laboratory presented a paper entitled "[Acar: An application-aware network routing system using SRv6](https://doi.org/10.1109/CCNC49033.2022.9700608)" at [IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC2022)](https://ccnc2022.ieee-ccnc.org/), held from January 8 to 11, 2022.

In this presentation, we introduced our research achievements on determining optimal routes for each application focusing on latency and throughput, and SRv6-based control methods based on these optimal routes.
