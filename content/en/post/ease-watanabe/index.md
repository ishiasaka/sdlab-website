Our SD Lab student gave their presentation(Title: 「On the Use of ChatGPT for Code Review」) at [Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE2024)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ease-2024).
In this study, we analyzed the purpose of using ChatGPT for code review and developers' responses to it on pull requests on GitHub.
