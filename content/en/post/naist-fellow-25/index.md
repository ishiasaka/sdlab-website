Yutaro Kashiwa, an assistant professor at SDLab, has been awarded the NAIST President's Fellow 2024.

The NAIST President's Fellow award was newly established in 2023 to recognize assistant professors who have received particularly outstanding evaluations in faculty assessments and have made significant contributions to education, research, social collaboration, and management operations at NAIST.

Among all assistant professors, two individuals, including Assistant Professor Yutaro Kashiwa from our laboratory, have been granted the title of NAIST President's Fellow for 2024.

During the ceremony, the President presented certificates and commemorative gifts, expressing high expectations for their future achievements.
