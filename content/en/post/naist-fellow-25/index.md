Yutaro Kashiwa, an assistant professor at SDLab,

The NAIST President's Fellow was newly established in 2023 as an award to recognize assistant professors who have shown particularly outstanding evaluations in faculty assessments, and who have made significant contributions to education and research, social collaboration, and management operations at NAIST.

In this second round of awards, two individuals, including Assistant Professor Yutaro Kashiwa from our laboratory, have been granted the title of NAIST President's Fellow 2024.

On the day of the ceremony, the President presented certificates and commemorative gifts, expressing high expectations for their future achievements.
