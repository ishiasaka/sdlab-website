Software systems are fundamental to modern society. With most companies organizing their economic activities around these systems, system quality has become a defining factor in corporate success. The Software Design and Analysis Laboratory develops software technologies that enable secure and reliable systems. Our work targets the building blocks of modern systems: source code, test code, networks, and infrastructure. We aim to make design, development, quality management, and operations more efficient. Below, we outline our laboratory's research in three major areas.


## [AI accelerating software development](/project/se4ai/)
Software development continues to accelerate year by year, with AI-powered automation of development processes at its core. For example, tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) use LLMs (Large Language Models) to handle much of the programming work, bringing us closer to a world where AI takes over a significant portion of coding tasks. We are working on research to further accelerate software development by fully leveraging artificial intelligence and big data analysis beyond just programming, automating processes traditionally performed by developers across other stages of development as well.

## [Software development automation achieving NoOps (No Operations)](/project/noops/)
To deliver high-quality software to users in shorter timeframes, modern software development projects employ DevOps practices that automate testing and releases. For instance, continuous integration, which automates compilation and testing with every software change, is one such practice. Our lab aims to advance DevOps further, automating a broader range of operations including bug detection and correction, operational monitoring, and more, ultimately achieving NoOps where human intervention becomes entirely unnecessary.

## [Software analytics pursuing the ideal state of source code and projects](/project/software-analytics/)
Modern software development leverages various systems and tools such as Git, pull requests, and bug tracking systems to improve efficiency. These systems accumulate development data, making it possible to analyze when, who, and what kind of development took place. Additionally, over 128 million repositories are publicly available on GitHub, all of which can be analyzed.
The field known as software analytics aims to analyze this vast accumulation of public data and partner company data, enabling individuals and teams in software development to make better decisions. Our lab also extracts data on feature implementation, refactoring, testing, and more from development repositories, pursuing through analysis what problems developers face and how those problems should be resolved.
